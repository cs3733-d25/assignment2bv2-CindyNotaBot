            <p>Hiiiii, my name is {tranName} and I am a sophomore studying Comp Sci.
                I love reading, watching shows, and listening to new music. My favorite animal is
                the jellyfish because I love how cute they look! I want to get a math minor because
                I think that would be fun, and one of my life goals is to own a pigeon.</p>
